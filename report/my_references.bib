	abstract = {Since the introduction of their modern form 20 years ago, recommender systems have proven a valuable tool for help users manage information overload. Two decades of research have produced many algorithms for computing recommendations, mechanisms for evaluating their effectiveness, and user interfaces and experiences to embody them. It has also been found that the outputs of different recommendation algorithms differ in user-perceptible ways that affect their suitability to different tasks and information needs. However, there has been little work to systematically map out the space of algorithms and the characteristics they exhibit that makes them more or less effective in different applications. As a result, developers of recommender systems must experiment, conducting basic science on each application and its users to determine the approach(es) that will meet their needs.

This thesis presents our work towards recommender engineering: the design of recommender systems from well-understood principles of user needs, domain properties, and algorithm behaviors. This will reduce the experimentation required for each new recommender application, allowing developers to design recommender systems that are likely to be effective for their particular application.

To that end, we make four contributions: the {LensKit} toolkit for conducting experiments on a wide variety of recommender algorithms and data sets under different experimental conditions (offline experiments with diverse metrics, online user studies, and the ability to grow to support additional methodologies), along with new developments in object-oriented software configuration to support this toolkit; experiments on the configuration options of widely-used algorithms to provide guidance on tuning and configuring them; an offline experiment on the differences in the errors made by different algorithms; and a user study on the user-perceptible differences between lists of movie recommendations produced by three common recommender algorithms. Much research is needed to fully realize the vision of recommender engineering in the coming years; it is our hope that {LensKit} will prove a valuable foundation for much of this work, and our experiments represent a small piece of the kinds of studies that must be carried out, replicated, and validated to enable recommender systems to be engineered.},

They are the exponential diffusion kernel, the Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel, the von Neumann diffusion kernel, the regularized Laplacian kernel, the commute-time (or resistance-distance) kernel, the random-walk-with-restart similarity matrix, and finally, a kernel first introduced in this paper (the regularized commute-time kernel) and two kernels defined in some of our previous work and further investigated in this paper (the Markov diffusion kernel and the relative-entropy diffusion matrix). The kernel-on-graphs approach is simple and intuitive. It is illustrated by applying the nine kernels to a collaborative-recommendation task, viewed as a link prediction problem, and to a semisupervised classification task, both on several databases. The methods compute proximity measures between nodes that help study the structure of the graph. Our comparisons suggest that the regularized commute-time and the Markov diffusion kernels perform best on the investigated tasks, closely followed by the regularized Laplacian kernel. ",
